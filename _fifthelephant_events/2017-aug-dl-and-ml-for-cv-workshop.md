    Human body is the most complex machine on Earth. It is undoubtedly fascinating how the Human Visual System works. How as a human, we see the world, store the visual information and learn from what we see and recognize the next time. The goal of the workshop is to build an understanding of how Computer Vision itself evolved from basic Image Processing to what it is now with exciting examples. With the help of Machine Learning and Deep learning, we are able to attain state-of-art performance in many fields. The workshop is meant for those who want to get started with solving Computer Vision problems easily and more elegantly using ML / DL with hands-on.

    #### Who is it for? 

    - Beginners in any of Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Deep learning
    - Or those with exposure to ML / DL and new to ML / DL in Computer Vision

    #### Outline
    The workshop builds an intuition behind how a digital image is captured, stored and processed. It shows what are the traditional and simple object detection mechanisms in Computer Vision and their limitations by examples. Then we show how Machine Learning came to the aid and solved the problems which the traditional CV techniques could not solve.

    We will spend time on analyzing the limitations of Machine Learning and how we can achieve them using the Deep Learning techniques. We will dive into the Black box (DL) and try to understand what each layer is doing exactly and how we can play around with them. We will finally talk about how to approach a Computer Vision problem, which technique to use, which parameter to tweak, etc.,

    The workshop is going to have 3 major parts each with a lot of exciting examples to try out using Jupyter notebook. At the end of the workshop, each participant should be able to build a network using Keras (Python library for Deep Learning), train and test the model. It is going to be a more Hands-on and relatively less Mathematical, especially for the beginners to Computer Vision.

    **Part I**

    - Motivation: Interesting use cases where Computer Vision with Deep learning outperforms
    - What is Computer Vision?
    - Simple Computer Vision based classification (hands-on)

    **Part II**

    - Machine Learning in CV
    - Classification using ML (hands-on)

    **Part III**

    - Emergence and Dominance of Deep Learning
    - Applications of DL (hands-on)
    - Compare ML and DL (hands-on)
    - How to solve a CV problem by choosing the appropriate technique?
    
    #### Software
    
    - The participants have to install the required software before the session (link will be provided shortly).
    - We will conduct a Installation Clinic to help the participants install the software package one day before the session.
    - We would like to have one volunteer to help the participants in case of any software conflicts
